# React Context API


In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application.

## Props drilling:
Props drilling is when a higher component owns a piece of data that a lower component needs, you will need to pass props down to components for the sole purpose of passing it down to the child component that needs it.
Lets take a look at this example:

```jsx
const Button = ({ theme }) => (
  <button style={{ backgroundColor: theme === "dark" ? "black" : "blue" }}>
    Click me
  </button>
);

const Submenu = ({ theme }) => <Button theme={theme} />;

const Toolbar = ({ theme }) => <Submenu theme={theme} />;

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    theme: "dark",
  };

  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme={this.state.theme} />;
  }
}

```
We had to pass down props through multiple levels until it got to the button which decided how the button will look, what if we needed that in another component thats not the toolbar?
Imagine another buttons in the app.
Thats when Props drilling becomes a problem, code becomes messy, a lot of redundant code.

## How can we solve this problem?
React provides us with something called the Context API.
Context in English means "a frame that surrounds the event and provides resources for its appropriate interpretation".
In React terms, its the information that the component needs to decide some decisions on its behaviour and appearance. 

## What's Context in React?
> Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### OK I think i got it... show me code!

But first we will go over the API:

### 1. React.createContext
```jsx
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);

export default MyContext;
```

Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.


### 2. Context.Provider
Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

Accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

```jsx
import MyContext from './MyContext'
const App = () => 
 <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
 {/* React children (components) that can subscribe and see the value passed above */}
 </MyContext.Provider>
```

All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes.

### 3. Context.Consumer

```jsx
import MyContext from "./MyContext";

const Button = () => (
  <MyContext.Consumer>
    {(value) => <button /* render something based on the context value */ />}
  </MyContext.Consumer>
);
```
A React component that subscribes to context changes. This lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.

Requires a function as a child. The function receives the current context value and returns a React node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.

### 4. Class.contextType
```jsx
import MyContext from "./MyContext";

class MyClass extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
  }
}

MyClass.contextType = MyContext;
```
The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). This lets you consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context. You can reference this in any of the lifecycle methods including the render function.

## Exercise

Enough talking, lets do an exercise.

1. clone this repo
2. `npm i && npm start`

### Task
You will find a React app, that has a lot of components, take your time reading them.
You wil notice that it applies props drilling extensively.
And you will find a bug somewhere, that the app doesnt work successfully, fix it, make sure its working, THEN refactor the code to use Context.
